//POLE - Principle of Least Exposure

// Closure builds on this approach: for variables we need to use over time, instead of placing them in larger outer scopes,
//we can encapsulate (more narrowly scope) them but still preserve access from inside functions, for broader use. 
//Functions remember these referenced scoped variables via closure.

//Closure is a behavior of functions and only functions. If you aren't dealing with a function,
// closure does not apply. An object cannot have closure, nor does a class have closure 
//(though its functions/methods might). Only functions have closure.

//After each call to lookupStudent(..) finishes, it would seem like all its inner variables would be 
//discarded and GC'd (garbage collected). The inner function is the only thing that seems to be returned and 
//preserved. But here's where the behavior differs in ways we can start to observe.

//While greetStudent(..) does receive a single argument as the parameter named greeting, 
//it also makes reference to both students and studentID, identifiers which come from the enclosing 
//scope of lookupStudent(..).

//Each of those references from the inner function to the variable in an outer scope is called a closure.

//Closure allows greetStudent(..) to continue to access those outer variables even after the outer scope is 
//finished (when each call to lookupStudent(..) completes). 

//Instead of the instances of students and studentID being GC'd, they stay around in memory. At a later time 
//when either instance of the greetStudent(..) function is invoked, those variables are still there, holding their current values.

    };
}

var addTo10 = adder(10);
var addT040 = adder(40);

console.log(addTo10(33));
console.log(addTo10(22));

// closure is associated with an instance of a function, rather than its single lexical definition.
// every time the outer adder(..) function runs, a new inner addTo(..) function instance is created, 
//and for each new instance, a new closure.

// So each inner function instance (labeled add10To(..) and add42To(..) in our program) has its own closure 
//over its own instance of the scope environment from that execution of adder(..).

// later

hits();     // 1

// later

hits();     // 2
hits();     // 3

//The count variable is closed over by the inner getCurrent() function, which keeps it around instead of it
// being subjected to GC. The hits() function calls access and update this variable, returning an incrementing count each time.



/*****outer scope can/cannot be a function*****/

//Though the enclosing scope of a closure is typically from a function, that's not actually required; 
//there only needs to be an inner function present inside an outer scope:

//The inner function nobody() doesn't close over any outer variablesâ€”it
//only uses its own variable msg. Even though studentID is present in 
//the enclosing scope, studentID is not referred to by nobody().


//If there's no function invocation, closure can't be observed:

//DEFINETION

//Closure is observed when a function uses variable(s) from outer 
//scope(s) even while running in a scope where those variable(s) wouldn't be accessible.

//The key parts of this definition are:

//Must be a function involved

//Must reference at least one variable from an outer scope

//Must be invoked in a different branch of the scope chain from the variable(s)
